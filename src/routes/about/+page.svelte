<h1 class="pb-4"> About Me </h1>
<p class="leading-relaxed pb-4">
    My name is Suchaaver Chahal. I'm a software engineer who also paints and writes. A creator, if you will. Some might argue that a software engineer doesn't fit that category. I disagree. Anyone who makes things is a creator. The method of creation might differ, but if the tools allow for self-expression, then the result is the same.

<p class="leading-relaxed">
    This site is built from scratch, but on the shoulders of giants. Those giants are Svelte and Tailwind, not to mention helpful modules for things like markdown transformation.
