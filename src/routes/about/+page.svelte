<h2 class="pb-4">Me</h2>
<p class="pb-8 leading-relaxed">
	My name is Suchaaver Chahal. I'm a software engineer who also paints and writes. A creator, if you
	will. Some might argue that a software engineer doesn't fit that category. I disagree. Anyone who
	makes things is a creator. The method of creation might differ, but if the tools allow for
	self-expression, then the result is the same.

<h2 class="pb-4">This Site</h2>
<p class="leading-relaxed">
	This site is built from scratch, but on the shoulders of giants. Those giants are Svelte and
	Tailwind, not to mention helpful modules for things like markdown transformation.
