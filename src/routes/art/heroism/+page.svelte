	<p>
		I have long since wanted to paint this pair, perhaps because in their exchanges, I see myself
		talking to ... myself.
	</p>
	<br />

	<p>
		A book called "Give and Take" by Adam Grant illustrates the idea that "Givers" help others
		achieve success, which eventually leads them to their own success. "Takers" put their success
		above the needs of others. They achieve success as well, but it is not as long-lasting and
		life-changing as a consistent "Giver". Given these definitions, Izuku is a Giver, and Bakugo a
		Taker. Early on, this behavior responds accordingly. Izuku sees greater success than Bakugo --
		gaining the trust of peers and mentors for his selfless behavior. But it is not as it seems, for
		the weight of our expectations changes us all.
	</p>
	<br />

	<i>
		"If the way you admired him was correct, then does that mean my admiration was wrong?" - Bakugo,
		during him and Izuku's fight after saving Bakugo from the League of Villains.
	</i>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		Bakugo is talking about All Might, but what neither of them understood then was nobody's
		admiration was correct. For Izuku, it was heroism at any cost -- self-sacrifice, as illustrated
		by his decision to take out the 0 point monster in the entry exam to UA. The weight of being the
		heir of One for All forced a knee to bend, a kind personality trait transformed into an ideal,
		and the Giver ... gave way. "Izuku" was slowly abandoned for "Deku", in much the same way that
		Bruce Wayne is the mask. Self-sacrifice does not ask for help from others.
	</p>
	<br />

	<p>
		And what of Bakugo's admiration? The Symbol of Peace is a symbol of Power. Heroism is a
		byproduct of sheer strength used for the right reason. For his entire childhood, Bakugo was
		lauded as strong. Pride became attached to that strength, and with pride came an immense fear of
		failure. Perfection was the final response. Bakugo's ambition to be the #1 becomes impure,
		fueled by an expectation followed by a self-hatred that burns incredibly hot, perhaps almost
		explosive. It's an isolating, spiraling desperation. Sheer strength does not ask for help from
		others.
	</p>

	<br />
	<i>
		"When my feeling of 'I have to beat you' is stronger than 'I have to save you' ... but the thing
		is, my mental image of 'victory' ... is you. ... I want to beat you, the incarnation of
		victory!" - Izuku, to himself during their fight after recovering Bakguo from the League of
		Villains.
	</i>
	<br />

	<br />
	<p>
		Every time Izuku and Bakugo had an exchange, they chipped away at each other. For Izuku, it was
		an honest admission that his strength was, in part, for more fallible reasons than the raw
		pursuit of any heroic ideal. While this impurity was the fuel off which Bakugo's ideal feeds, it
		was the chink in Deku's armor.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		In their pursuit of their ideals, I find parallels in their power and consequently, isolation.
		Bakugo, despite being surrounded by people that genuinely care for him, emotionally isolates
		because dependence on them is weakness he cannot afford. Izuku, in the same situation,
		physically isolates (in the vigilante arc) because dependence on them is a liability he cannot
		afford. Both put ideal above humanity, and for it they fracture again and again. Because an
		ideal is pure, it alone justifies itself. An ideal cannot break. But humanity is impure.
		Humanity does not exist alone. So humanity must break.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>I am reminded of something Archer in Fate/Stay Night says:</p>
	<i> If all you ever fight for are ideals, then all you will ever save are ideals. </i>
	<br />
	<br />
	<i>
		"...but I mean it Izuku. I'm sorry for everything I did. Every action you take is in the right
		direction. But you can barely stand now." - Bakugo, when they bring Izuku back during the
		vigilante arc.
	</i>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p>
		Bakugo was never filled with more self-conflict than when Deku acted. When Deku spoke, Bakugo
		grew angry. When Deku acted, Bakugo grew to doubt himself. Eventually Deku's righteousness
		caused Bakugo's self-image to shatter, which was the only way he could be rebuilt. I used "Deku"
		instead of "Izuku" on purpose in those last few sentences. On the other hand, Izuku latches on
		to Bakugo's words. He champions "Deku", an insult Bakugo gave him. Yet in this scene, Bakugo
		does not say "Deku." He says "Izuku", and he says "I'm sorry".
		<strong>"Izuku"</strong> because nobody can be a hero before they are a person.
		<strong>"I'm sorry"</strong>
		because Izuku's heroism was perversed by a need to prove Bakugo wrong.
		<strong>"I'm sorry"</strong>
		because it's the most difficult and authentic thing for a man cursed by pride to say.
		<strong>"I'm sorry"</strong> because Izuku is sorry as well.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		We may not be anything like these two, but we all find fragments of ourselves in each character.
		Perhaps the paintings exist as a dialogue between the two. "Heavy is the Crown" as Deku
		acknowledging the isolation and crushing weight of self-expectation that were suffocating
		Bakugo. "Is This the Strength You Sought?" as Bakugo asking Deku if the Hero is worth the price
		of the man.
