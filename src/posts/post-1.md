_Expect spoilers. This article takes a look at the game's design. If you don't want the game spoiled, stop reading._

I enjoy playing competitive multiplayer video games, and it's been that way for the majority of my life. However, I decided recently that I want to explore some single player games as a way for me to decompress for fifteen or thirty minutes after the work day. It's more relaxing than the alternative, and provides a lot of insight into what good (and bad) design decisions look like.

I didn't want to pick up an AAA game with over 30 hours of gameplay because that seemed daunting. I was looking for something small, which has the added benefit of being indie (usually more provocative and innovative). I landed on a perfect title: "A Short Hike" by Adam Robinson Yu (adamgryu online). The most important thing that stood out to me as I finished it was how it made an obviously finite game seem like an intentional and **achievable open world**.

### A Short Hike

You are an anthropomorphic bird visiting a national park on an island, and you decide you are going to hike to the top of Hawk's Peak. The premise is simple, and the game feels tight. What I mean is that, through clever design, I was exposed to the mechanics necessary to explore the world without being told explicitly when to use them. The players often see the puzzles laid out in front of them and appreciate their designs, but the developer has to solve the larger puzzle of helping the player understand the set of their abilities and their interactions without the need for exposition. The game did not give the player hard, illogical boundaries. Instead, the island was architected such that as I played and gained more abilities, I realized I could go back and explore that which I was unable to previously.

Before going further, what does "open world" mean? Open world games are loosely defined as games that aren't split into individual levels with a specific order. Instead, the player can explore a large portion of the game space in whatever way they see fit. The narrative still progresses in a predetermined order and does provide some limits on what the player is able to do, but otherwise they are left to their own devices. Many games have done good open world concepts (Breath of The Wild comes to mind), but a common pitfall of them is in the design of content that isn't the main narrative. It is time consuming (and expensive) to craft whole new experiences for every side quest made available to the player. To alleviate this, procedural generation and other techniques are used to create content that appears unique without needing brand new art, logic, etc. However, this only gets you so far, and players can tell the side content is hollow after experiencing it a few times. The challenge of large open world games is finding the balance between hand-crafted intentional experience design and procedural design, to make every aspect of the world worth exploring.

With this definition, _A Short Hike_ fits the category of open world. But what makes it "achievable?" To me, it's:

1.  The developers can create all the content for it without relying on gimmicks to inflate the time spent playing without meaningful reward (i.e. procedurally generated fluff).

2.  The player thinks it is well worth their time to explore beyond the game's main narrative because the other content feels meaningful.

_A Short Hike_ limited its own scope from the outset, and thus was able to craft every experience and interaction uniquely, building upon the same mechanics that were required to reach the peak. One of the side quests taught me how to cover more ground on the island faster, which was not required to reach the peak, but made the rest of my island exploration much easier. That's the kind of reward the incentivizes a player to continue talking to every character and walking off the main path. Other experiences were less directly useful, like learning to fish, but it fits the game's aesthetic very well: a calm and cozy way to pass the time.

I do not believe the game would fit my definition of achievable, however, if the main character movement loop was obtuse. In this case, _A Short Hike_ knocked it out of the park. The variations in movement qualities were well strung together in such a way that the act of traversing the island was entertaining unto itself. I spent a lot of time just combining running, jumping, gliding, and diving in different ways to see what parts of the island I could traverse in what ways.

Through a high quality movement system and a well-defined and communicated (to the player) scope, _A Short Hike_ manages to create a world that feels better to explore than it does to complete. The creator did a wonderful in-depth breakdown of the development process at GDC, which you can check out HERE.
