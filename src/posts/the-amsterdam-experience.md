I just came back from living in Amsterdam for a month. The weather was fantastic (I was not supposed to see the sun). I discoverd biking is truly the most freeing version of transportation, provided that the city treats the biker like a first-class citizen and not an afterthought. I could say a lot more about the museums (artsy) and the people (ex-patsy), but I'll take a slightly different approach. Inspired by the big names in fine art here, I'll describe some highlights through my art.

### An Afternoon Break

The first day I visited Vondelpark, a marathon was being held. Runners went by, friends cheered in support, and I waited for someone else to lift the tape and cross the path before I decided it was an okay thing to do. I didn't have to wait long. As I got away from the crowd and the sun started to dip down, I stumbled upon a man eating by a tree with his bike next to him. I'm a sucker for afternoon glow, and I had been looking for my first subject anyway.

### Windmills

I'm taking liberty with the article title because not every subject of my paintings is from Amsterdam. "The Netherlands Experience" didn't sound as good. Maybe "The Dutch Experience" would have done it, but it felt misleading. Anwyay, a day trip to Zaanse Schans, a historic neighborhood in the town of Zaandam, was an easy train ride away. It's a glimpse of Holland before the industrial revolution. One of the main attractions here are the windmills, which are set up to power various industrial processes. There's a paper mill, a paint processing mill, a wood mill, and more. There was a concern that the weather would not cooperate given the season, but I was lucky. Blue skies, light cloud cover, and brisk air -- I couldn't ask for much more.

### A Friend by the Canal

As I was riding back from a musuem visit, I took some time to sit at a bench by one of the many canals. I took out my sketchbook, picked out a duck, and put pen to paper. After a few minutes I looked up and realized that a woman had sat down on the bench to my left, and she had taken out some kind of book as well. I caught a glimpse of what may have been a drawing, so I thought she may have been an artist as well. Why is that important? Well, I really wanted to do a painting that involved a figure as the strong focus, but to do that I needed reference. And by reference, I mean I needed to take someone's photo in public. I barely take photos of myself, so the task was somewhat difficult. But who could better understands the task at hand than a fellow artist? So I introduced myself, and as it turned out, she was an artist! We talked a little a bit about life in Amsterdam, she recommended a few places for me to visit, and she gave me permission to take her photo. Her art is unique and fun, and you can see more of it [here](https://www.instagram/com/PERSON)

### Nature

Aforementioned friend said I might enjoy visiting De Hoge Veluwe National Park because inside it is the Kroller Muller museum, which hosts the second largest collection of Van Gogh paintings. I decided to rent a car to get there, and though it was raining in Amsterdam, it was not raining in the national park. I made a day of it -- got there in the morning, ate some food and had a coffee at their cafe, walked some of the trails in the park, and spent time in the museum. The musuem had a lot to offer -- the Van Gogh collection was large, but they had many other artists and mediums on display, including a large sculpture garden. One of the most interesting exhibits, however, was by a modern artist named Vincent Dams. It was an exhibition of the life of his self-imagined filmmaker Enzo Diga. It's worth a whole article unto itself, but what I will say here is that I found myself laughing softly the whole time I was in that exhibit. I really enjoyed it.

I wanted to make a painting of the forest, but the day was overcast. I could have imagined some lighting and painted what I didn't see, but having worked through my fear of poor lighting scenarios (with some [help](https://slawekfedorczuk.site)) I decided to go for it. That said, I'm still allowed some creative liberty.

This isn't the first time I've done a series of paintings for a location I visited. However, I recently stumbled upon the concept of the [self appointed artist residency](https://amystewart.substack.com/p/the-self-appointed-artist-residency) and I thought it would be a neat way to frame the work. Maybe I'll host a viewing at my home, who knows.

I met some old friends in Amsterdam and made some new ones, and I like to think I made good use of my time there. Some people make scrapbooks to remember their trips, others put together videos of their trips. I ... make art.
